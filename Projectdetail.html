It focuses on teaching learners how to build a responsive form using HTML and CSS, incorporating best practices for accessibility and usability. Here are the key details and goals of this project:</p>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2><br>
            <h3>1. Form Elements:</h3><p>The form must include various types of inputs such as text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, and a text area. These elements should be used to collect different types of user information.</p>
            <h3>2. Form Structure:</h3>
            <p><b>a. Fieldset</b> and <b>Legend:</b> Use the fieldset and legend elements to group related form controls and provide a caption for the group, improving the form's accessibility.<br>
            <b>b. Labels:</b> Each form element should have a corresponding label element to improve accessibility and usability. Labels should be properly associated with their respective form controls.</p>
            <h3>3. Accessibility:</h3>
            <p><b>a. Semantic HTML:</b> Use appropriate HTML5 elements to ensure the form is semantic and accessible.<br>
            <b>b. ARIA Roles and Attributes:</b> Where necessary, use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of the form.<br>
            <h3>4. Responsive Design:</h3>
            <p><b>a.</b>  The form should be fully responsive, adjusting smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.<br>
            <b>b.</b> Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the form for various screen sizes.<br>
            <h3>5. Styling:</h3>
            <p><b>a.</b> Use CSS to style the form and make it visually appealing. This includes adding padding, margins, borders, and other styling properties to enhance the form's appearance.<br>
            <b>b.</b> Ensure that the form is easy to read and interact with, using sufficient contrast between text and background colors.<br>
            <h3>6. User Experience:</h3>
            <p><b>a.</b> the form is user-friendly by providing clear instructions and appropriate input types.<br>
            <b>b.</b> Use placeholder text to guide users on what information to enter in each input field.<br>
            <b>c.</b> Add hover and focus effects to form controls to improve the user's interaction experience.<br><br>
            <h2>Example Form Fields</h2>
            <p>A typical survey form might include the following fields:<br>
            <b>1. Name:</b> A text input for the user's name.<br>
            <b>2. Email:</b> A text input for the user's email address.<br>

            <b>6. Recommendations:</b> A dropdown menu for selecting recommendations (e.g., Yes, No, Maybe).<br>
            <b>7. Comments:</b> A text area for additional comments or feedback.</p>
            <h2>Additional Features</h2>
            <p>To make the form more interactive and functional, you can add JavaScript to validate the form inputs before submission, providing real-time feedback to users.</p>
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>Ensure the form meets the project requirements by testing it thoroughly on different devices and browsers. FreeCodeCamp provides a set of tests that can be run to verify that the form meets the specified criteria.</p>
            <h2>Summery</h2>
            <p>The FreeCodeCamp Survey Form project is an excellent way to practice building responsive forms using HTML and CSS. By following best practices for accessibility and usability, you can create a form that is both functional and user-friendly.
